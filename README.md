# Matrix Multiplication in C

This project performs matrix multiplication and verifies the results with expected matrices.

## Files

- **`matmul.c`**: Contains the matrix multiplication function.
- **`matmul.h`**: Header file for the matrix multiplication function (optional).
- **`driver.c`**: Main program that reads matrices, calls the `matrix_multiplication` function, and verifies the result.
- **`Unit_test/`**: Contains unit test cases with input matrices `A.txt`, `B.txt`, and the expected output `C.txt`.

## Steps to Build and Run

Follow the steps below to build and run the program:

- I added the following to the **"Steps to Build and Run"** section:
  - ## Step 1: 
    Navigate to the project folder using `cd Matrix_Multiplication`
  - ## Step 2:
    Compile the project using `g++ driver.c matmul.c -o driver`
  - ## Step 3: 
    Run the program using `./driver`
